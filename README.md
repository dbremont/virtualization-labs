# virtualization-labs

> Virtualization Labs is a hands-on exploration of virtualization technologies, from hypervisors and hardware acceleration to containers and cloud-native environments.

These labs provide a structured way to:
- Experiment with Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors.
- Analyze performance trade-offs between full virtualization, paravirtualization, and containerization.
- Secure virtualized environments against side-channel attacks and misconfigurations.

Whether testing KVM on Linux, deploying nested virtualization, or stress-testing cloud IaaS platforms, these labs bridge theory and real-world implementationâ€”helping engineers, researchers, and students master modern infrastructure abstraction.
